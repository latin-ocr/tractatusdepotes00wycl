this Pope, always uses the word “our''; but we must also take
into account that Urban VI was the Pope whom the Kingdom
of England had acknowledged‚ and this for Wyclif was always
a decisive point. It follows therefore that it is no paradox to
speak of Papacy as Antichristian‚ and yet to acknowledge one
particular Pope as a true one. And this shows us, too, how
unsafe it is to take such utterances of our author in order to
determine the date of any particular tractate.

If we look more closely into this, we shall notice that in
this very tractate, De Potestate Pap-e, there is an undercurrent
of doubt all through, as to whether Urban VI is not himself a
false Pope; we shall see that the whole tendency of the work
is to prove that the Church does not need a Pope for its
existence. There are certain deeds of both Popes which indi-
cate them as Antichrists. In one place he says: “Neither by his
deeds nor by Divine revelation can we be assured that our
Urban VI is the lawful Pope.’' Such is the standpoint taken
by Wyclif in his Polemz'cal Works, his Sermones and his Opus
Evangelz'cum3 and we shall not go astray, if we take the year
1380 as the date when he finally made up his mind on the
subject. It was therefore in 1379, or at the latest towards the
beginning of 1380, that De Potestate Pap& was written. We may
also find a motive for Wyclif's later attitude in his personal
relations towards Urban VL2

There is one remark in De Potesta-te Pape that might throw
light upon the question of its date. He says that the adver-
saries of Richard II accused him of a special form of heresy -
that of employing mercenaries against Holy Church —- not-
withstanding his extreme youth, which ought to have shielded
him from any such attacks. This has obviously nothing to do
with the Great Schism. If it alludes to some incident within
the Kingdom‚ this would probably be the attack on West-
minster Abbey, which excited so much indignation at the time,
