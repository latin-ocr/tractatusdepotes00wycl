tries and persons having submitted to Antichrist is no proof
demonstrative of Papal authority and dignity; even the devil
would refute such an argument. This is illustrated by an anec-
dote quoted by Wyclif from> Walsingham.¹

As to the favourable testimony of Doctors‚ we should be-
lieve thern only when they are the channels of God's Word.
Nothing of the sort is to be met with in the works of the four
greatest Doctors. In fact, the Pope's tempora] power proceeds
from the Emperors, as is indeed to be seen by Constantine's
decree. Christianity has nothing to do With the privileges and
indulgences granted by the Pope.‘2 Since all men receive indul-
gences from God according as they deserve them, it is not
the Pope's business to bestow them, save only as God's in-
strument. A doctrine similar to ours‚ it is said, was promulgated
by Urban VI to the cardinals created by Gregory XI -- he
ordered them to return to evangelica] poverty. And for that
reason they abandoned him and elected Robert of Geneva to
rule over them; a wicked, proud⁷ and quarrelsome man who
has no idea of sanctity.3 May the English never accept him as
a teacher! We are willing to follow Urban VI, so far as he
follows in God's way, but no farther. If, by a miracle, Robert
should also wall< in the same way, then we can with 3 clear
conscience adhere to both. Distance of place should not prevent
us from following the best men indifferently in all that is good.

It follows from what has been said that this power of the
Pope, which was given them by the Emperors, is a mere fiction
from which we should shrink as from poison. The Apostle's
power had only to do with converting and edifying the people,
and leading a saintly life; this power was the same in all.
Therefore no indulgences granted by bulls are valid‚ and the
Spirit of God needs no bulls to act in our souls.
