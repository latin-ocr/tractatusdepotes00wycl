l. Contents of De potestate Pape.

Wyclif, in the volume now before us, begins by putting
forward certain fundamental notions. To treat of the power
which belongs to the Pope, it is necessary to have a clear idea
of the nature of this power, and of the different significations
given to the words even in the earliest times. It is only then
that we shall know what the power of the Church is according
to Christ⁷s ordinance3 or in other words, what hierarchy He
gave it, and how this hierarchy has shaped and evolved itself.
To Speak of the Church, we must know what the Church 15,
what its various parts are, and how different the Churchcis now
from what it was in the days of the Apostles. Whilst Wyclif
appeals to Holy Scripture almost at every page, and makes it
the basis of his expositione, it is easy to see that he assumes
a previous acquaintance with his treatises De Ecclesia and De
Ῑῖενίίαίε, which had been written before.

What is Power? According to Aristotle, it is the principle
of movement, of productiori and destruction, it is either increate,
an attribute of God alone, —— and as such infinite and eternal3 —
or created in time and either spiritual or material. Spiritual
power, given to the creature, is indeed permanent and in-
destructible, but may be limited in its action. Material power
may be gained or lost.

Another kind of power is the capacity of any creature to
be influenced from without; and therefore there must be, not
only active, but passive power.

A third kind 15 the capacity of doing a thing aright: this
is either internal or external. In man, according to Anselm² it
is called free-will, which may be —- either totally or only in
part -— lost by sin.

FinaHy, power may be an acquired capacity to produce an
alteration in another subject. In man, it is either supernatural„
and designed for the utility of the Church‚ or politica] and
intended to resist the enemies of the Church.

A perusal of Holy Scripture will show us that there are
many other significations of this word. The sixth Choir of Angels,
