stood in the earliest times, then the position of secular govern-
ments would also be more favourable.1 They say as a proof
of the latter’s inferiority: The Pope was instituted by Christ,
the Emperor by men. This is false. The Pope as he exists at
present was brought in by the Emperor, and Christ instituted
a form of Papacy such as is not to be seen to-day. At present
the Pope trusts in his privileges; a true servant of God laughs
them to scorn.

The second point is also false. The institution of royalty
proceeds, not from man, but directly from God.2

Dealing now with the well-known comparison between
Papacy and the sun, Wyclif says that a sun so liable to
eclipses is unnecessary3 a thousand manifest examples prove
clearly that the Church can exist without it.3 The Papal claims
remind us of the latter days of the Church. Of all those who
are from all eternity doomed to be castaways, and therefore
Antichrists —- one of them is greater than all others; and this

versaries of Christ.4 He takes upon himself to stand in the
Holy of Holies‚ and allows men to call him ‘Most Holy Father³.

potence, and are filled with lies regarding indulgences and
other matters. Certainly, not all Popes are antichrists. Caiaphas
was for instance a great Antichrist, but it does not follow
that every high priest was. Nero was too, but not necessarily
every emperor. So was Sergius; but not therefore every monk.
Whoso deceives the people by Church censures, is above all
others an Antichrist. His helpers are those priests who in our
