form a body unwarranted by Scripture; neither their name nor
their institution is mentioned therein. Most of them are not
even priests3 in no way do they come in the name of the Lord,
but only, like Gehazi and Simon, to take Church property and
money. They can work no miracles, they do not pray or preach
either for those who have instituted thern or who approve
their deeds. How then can such monsters have received the
power to declare who the Head of the Church is?1 They even
set up amongst themselves the most unworthy of all as their
chief, and call him Pope, after their fashion, but cannot make
him to be Head of the Church.2 Moreover‚ we are forbidden
to abandon the forms observed by the Apostles. When the
Jews desired a King against God’s will, they sinned, how much
morel do Christians sin when, against the Evangelical law, they
set up a man to be more than a King, and call him Pope! This
sort of electiori has obtained only since the secularization of
the Church, which has been poisoned with riches and power.
F ormerly there was no difference between the presbyter, bishop
and priest; there were only deacons besides, whose duty it
was to take the function of preaching, now neglected on ac-
count of this election. The choice of a Pope, and the modern
fashion of bestowing livings, breeds hirelings; it gives the Popes
an opportunity to aggrandize themselves without opposition,
and to increase their worldly dignity and their imaginary
holiness: for all those doctors who expect temporal remuner-
ation from the Roman Curia flatter it and say that this power
is boundless, because it is able to do all that Christ did on
earth, and even more. In reality, a faithful priest of Christ has
no power to absolve3 he can merely proclaim God’s sentence
that the sinner is forgiven. Whoever misuses the Power of the
Keys, and sets himself in opposition to the Church Triumphant,
loses that power by the very fact. Such abuses have comple-
