INTRODUCTION. III

for instance, bears the name of Powers. The word frequently
means the same as dominion,· frequently, too, it bears a figurative
signification. All these meanings are in accordance with Holy Writ.

If we restrict ourselves to the consideration of power, as
it exists in reasonable creatures‚ we shall find a great many
subdivisions: it is either spiritual or tempoml, original or
delegated.l Amongst these divisions, the most generally accepted
is that given by Hugo a Sancto Victore: man's life being two-
fold, spiritual and bodily, his power is two-sold also, spiritual
and tempora1‚ and each has many and various grades. The Pope
is at the summit of the one, the king at the summit of the
other. Each has its own laws and its proper character: the lay
power, following nature, has earthly welfare for its goa1; the
spiritual power makes for virtue and follows the law of grace.
As spiritual is superior to secular power, as to antiquity, dignity,
and usefulness, it came to pass that in the beginning the people
of Israel was governed only by the spiritual power.

This division may be objected to, because one and the same
person may wield both powers: as in the case of Melchisedech.
Again, under the New Covenant, the clergy has aspired to
tempora] dominion3 and lastly it is the King's duty to uproot
the vices of the clergy: which is tantamount to spiritual power.
We must, therefore, seek for a better definition: Spiritual Power
is the power of the Spirit, under whose immediate guidance
man is led to follow God’s grace. Every man is also a spirit,
in his double nature of body united to soul; and if he is not
himself the dispenser of grace, he may be the dispenser of the
Sacraments, by which his inferiors are led forward in the way
of grace. Secular power aims at happiness and progress from
a natural point of view. Thus every man possesses two-sold
power, spiritual and secular.2 Spiritual power is of two kinds;
one belonging to the clergy alone, the other shared by all alike.
One dispenses the Sacraments; the other practises the spiritual
