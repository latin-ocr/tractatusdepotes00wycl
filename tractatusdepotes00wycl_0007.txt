I NTRODUCTION.

Of the twelve books which the Summa Theologiae contains,
the ninth has hitherto not received the attention to which its
contents entitle it. ln point of importance only one of all the
twelve can be compared to it: De Ecclesia, which, together with
De Veritate Sacre Ξενίρίῑὶνε, precedes De Potestate Pape,· ancl
this work would present many obscure passages, but for the
knowledge of the other two, It is because this book was
unknown to the biographers of the English Reformer that not
one of them has correctly described his attitude in regard to
the Papacy: for it contains his theory of true and false Papacy,
which must be known in order to understand the position which
he takes on this subject in his later works. As I intend to deal
with Wyclif’s doctrine in a special treatise‚ these hints must
suffice for the present. ἶ must only add that Wyclif's friends
and disciples were perfectly aware how great a treasure they
had in this book. If we peruse the famous treatise, De Ecclesia,
by Huss, which contributed to his condemnation at the Council
of Constance‚ we shall see that it is but an echo of Wyclif's
De Ecclesia, and also of his De Potestase Pape.

From another standpoint —— that of form - this treatise
ought to be highly valued. Even Setting aside the exhaustive
quotations and definitions of the word “Power'’, in which our
author still keeps strictly to the Scholastic and Aristotelian
method, De Potestas& Papa would still be, together with the
Trialogus, the most striking productiori of his pen, on account
of the unity of its contents: a circumstance which obliges us to

summarize these contents at greater length.
