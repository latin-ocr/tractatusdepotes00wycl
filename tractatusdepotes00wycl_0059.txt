De Simonz‘a and De Ezhclzaristia ——- are of no further use in fixing
the date of De Potestate‚ and need no further consideration.

Since a great part of De Potestate deals with the elections
both of Urban VI and of the antipope Clement VII, we must also
take into account the short controversial tract De Dissensioue
Paparmn, which, according to Dr. Buddensieg³s1 erudite re-
searcheS, was written towards the end of 1382 or at the beginning
of 1383. But if we compare the two, we shall find that this
tractate is of a later date than De Potestate.

There is too little of intrinsical evidence in De Potestale
to enable us to fix its date with greater certainty. Formerly it
was believed that Wyclif's greater or less leaning towards ⁴or
aversion from Pope Urban VI expressed in his works was a
standard by which we could fix the date of each of his sepa-
rate tractates written in his last years. This opinion, however,
is wrong. Wyclif might very well, though he rejected Papacy
in its then form, consider Urban VI to be the lawful Pope.
This does not imply any contradiction for one who is acquain-
ted with Wyclif's theory of true and false Papacy. The false
Papacy, the cImperial’ form of it, as it has existed since Con-
stantine, is distinguished by him from the true Papacy, the
ideal form which St. Bernard depicted with such brilliant hues.
But how can such a distinction be made between the true and the
false form? And is such a distinction even possible? Certainly,
and in a hundred ways, as Wyclif shows3 righteous works and
supreme holiness of life afford us a criterion by which we can
distinguish one from the other.2 According to this principle,
even in the ‘Imperial' Church a true Pope may be found. Is not
Urban VI just such a man of most holy life? Has he not, for the
first time since hundreds of years, brought back the College of
Cardinals to a life of evangelica] and apostolic poverty?3 We
can therefore understand why Wyclif, whenever he speaks of
