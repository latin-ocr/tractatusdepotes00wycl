XLIV INTRODUCTJON.

of the Holy Sacrament, of the Church, the Papal Power‚ the
secularization of Church property, the hurtfulness of monastic
life to the commonwealth‚ — and so forth — that kindled the
great revolution in Bohemia, which set half the world in
flames, As to De Ecclesia, Hus' tractate which bears the same
name as that of Wyclif‚ it proceeds from the latter as a foun-
tainhead‚ following it even in externals. Thus De Ecclesia, by
Hus, has just as many chapters as the same work by Wyclif.
And as Hus takes from Wyclif’s De Ecclesia all his theoretical
expositions on the subject and sets them forth as his own ideas
concerning the Church, so the idea of Papal Power and the
description of its evolution is taken word for word, though
more or less faithfully‚ from Wyclif’s De Potestatc Pape. Years
ago I selected passages and pointed out their similarity. The
text of the work in hand contains an accurate list of the pas-
sages appropriated by Hus in his De Ecclesia. Ι refrain from'
quoting them entire, but at all events two or three may be
given, which I have overlooked in the text; and the reader
will see, not only that there is dependence, but to what extent
this dependence goeS.
