INTRODUCTION. LI

of B had no special acquaintance with his subject-matter; for an
omitted word supplied by A in a side-note, has been placed by
him in a side-note too. Several other details lead us to conclude
that there is, between A and Β, a relation of dependence.

It is of interest, from a certain point of vieW‚ to read the
side-notes. They show that the copyist of A was of the Ca-
tholic way of thinking. He takes care to add in one place
(f. 225b) the following words: Nota argumentum optimum pro
papam esse et pro eius regimine, sed cave extortam evasionem
illius. . . . The arguments in favour of Papacy and Papal go-
vernment please him, but the author's final conclusions do not.
There are to be found besides such remarks as: Cave .. . cave
foveam; or Hic contradicit sibi; all of which show that the copyist
was not friendly to Wyclif's theological system. The reader will
also find (f. 395—397) some variants added under the lettering C,
from Cod. XI. E. 3. This MS. also contains (f. 583-5412), the
Protestation‘es multiplices Magistris Johannz's Wiclzff.

Amongst these Protestations, published by Hofler in
his Anna von Luxemburg, daughter of the Emperor Charles IV,
rvife of King Riclzard II, Queen of England, 1382—1394 (Procee-
dings of the Imperial Academy of ScienceS, vol. XXl⁷ there is
also a more lengthy one, taken out of De Potestate Pape, with
several variants of some importance. As we see by the recently
printed Catalogue of Prague University Lim-ary, these Prote-
stations are to be found not only in Cod. XI. E. 3 (now
Cod. 2050) but also in Codices X. H. 12 (now 1990) and XI.
D. 9 (now 2043).

4. Date of De Potestate Pape.

As already said, we suppose the reader to be already ac-
quainted with Wyclif's two great works: De Ecclesia and De
Ver-itate Sacre Scriptura This gives us a clue to the date

² Pro cuius declaracione necesse est supponere stabilimentum auctoritatis
scripture; de quo patet cap. XIV libri proximi3 see below p. 1. Cf. De Veritate sacre
scripture ed. Buddensieg I⁷ 331. As a matter of fact, both these works precede the

present one in the Summa.
