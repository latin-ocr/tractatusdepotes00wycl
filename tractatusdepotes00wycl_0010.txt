IV INTRODUCTION.

deeds of mercy. Secular power is also of two kinds: political
or general: the former belongs only to temporal rulers and
masters, the latter to the community at large3 but the aim of
both is to attain for oneself and others all the good gifts of
nature and happiness. It follows that every man, qua a compound
of body and 50111, possesses both general spiritual and secular
power; the latter, however, is not shared by children and idiots.
As spiritual power is from every point of view superior to
secular power, so the priestly power is also above that general
spiritual power aforesaid; but that it gives any right to temporal
possessions‚ is a vain imagination which priestly greed has
created.1

spiritual power is an immediate gift of God. No Pope can
either bestow or take it away; though he may have the right
to promulgate in due form that which God has commanded.
Such power can be neither augmented nor limited essentially;
but its exercise requires to be controlled. This power has been
given by God to those who desei-ve 11, quite independently of
any outward sacerdotal character. Therefore, in the primitive
Church, the Apostles never dared to say that they could delegate,
or limit, or take away this power3 nor did even Simon Magus
venture to claim anything of the sort. Civil power also proceeds

given to man by Him, save to carry out His own purposes.
Whoso‚ therefore, receives power from God, must act con-
formably to His will. Unhappily, men do not always thus cor-
respond to God’s designs. There are priests whose negligence
is accused, and by no means excused, by St. Pau13 and there
