VIII INTRODUCTloN.

Moreover, neither Peter, nor Paul, nor any of the other
Apostles, withheld the bishops whom they ordained from watch-
ing over the people; Peter’s distinguished position had no bear-
ing upon jurisdiction, nor did it give him any J‘uridical rights
over the whole Church Militant.1 The other Apostles, without
Peter’s permission, founded Churches in divers places: Paul

only so that Christ's Vicars may be enabled to perform their
task. The Decreta] of Nicolaus 111. Exiit qni seminat, calling the
order of St. Francis (the Minorites> a heavenly and entirely
perfect Order, because it is most like the earthly condition of
Christ and the Apostles, is an utterance made in this spirit. The
Roman Church and its Doctors ——- especially those of the
Minorite Order —— should, therefore, uphold the principle of
Evangelical poverty3 yet they do the contrary, and despise a
