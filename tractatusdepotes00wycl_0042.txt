XXXVI INTRODUCTION.

days obey his laws; and these men are for the most part
enemies to God's law. No better example can be given. If we
think that the laws of the Church are indispensaffle, it may be
replied that the Church was best governed when there were
no laws but God's; as God gave them, they are destined to
remain for ever. If the modern laws of the Church were better,
we ought to read the Decretals in Church as well as the
Epistles and Gospels. Christ’s law brings peace, and prepares
the way of salvation; it therefore excels all human traditionS‚
and excites mutual love amongst the faithful. It may be objected
that in that case justice could no longer be upheld. We reply:
God would see to that. Then would the secularization of the
Church come to an end3 and so forth. Many saints have al-
ready lamented the present hampering of Christ's law, The laws
of rnen often lead away from God, they are full of deceit and
injustice. This being so, it follows that the Pope should not
decide all Church matters by himself; this is shown by the
decrees of Boniface VIII„ which are contrary to God's law,1
The Apostles would not have issued such a decree. It is a
decree of Antichrist and a blasphemy to say that God approves
of all that such a law contains.

As to the second point, -— viz, that the Pope is necessary
in conferring benefices, —- here the law of Christ must decide.
His will, and a sign given by Him, will point out the man who
in His eyes is fit. The people are the best judges, and present
the worthiest Bishop. So it was of old: so it should be nOW.2
The Bible teaches best the duties of the priesthood: how a
priest should be inducted‚ watched over and corrected. The
present mode of presentation of Church livings was not known
to the Saints who were PopeS. Now for the most part they
get benefices by protection3 the examiners often do not so
much as know anything of the life of the chosen man.3 By
