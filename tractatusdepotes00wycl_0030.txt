XXIV INTRODUCTION.

according to this principle, when the election has been due to
military force or a tumult of the people;1 in other words, when,
as for Urban VL the choice being due to a riot is null and
void, is not the man whose election was caused by the devil
or the sins of the electors‚ to be considered rather as an apo-
state than as Peter's successor? No one who is not the son of
Christ and Peter can be Pope. This cannot be the result of
an election made by men3 and so such an election has no
power to make a Pope. That a man chosen by the Western
Church should receive the name of Pope is an abuse3 it has
no Scripture warrant, and the title has been introduced by a
secular law, But does the choice of men give a greater right
than the choice of God? Why) even Christ's choice, as we see
in the case of Judas Iscariot‚ does not necessarily mean eterna]
predestination and perfect grace.

Our chronicles show the growth of Papacy to be caused
by the power of the Emperors. This was just as if the Tartar
Khan were converted at the present day, and made the Church
of Kambalek in Cathay to be the first of all the churches. Then
the authority of Rome would be destroyed. Besides, the laws
made by the Popes concerning obedience to the Church of
Rome, should be understood as supposing that this Church
should be capable of performing its task.

1o. The objections to the preceding remarks are easy to
refute. If it be said that the Pope ought to be the most mighty
lord in the world, because be could not otherwise do what is
required of him as a duty3 that his inferiors in tempora] power
would not keep their places3 and lastly that tempora] power
is not a drawback‚ but a privilege, and that it ought therefore
to be upheld: Christ's example teaches the contrary. The legate
Otho attempted in the year 1226 to extort money; but John
Marshall most energetically withstood this attempt. Indeed, the
claim then made by the Roman Curia was scandalous. If the
Curia has been maintained for centuries by the alms of the
