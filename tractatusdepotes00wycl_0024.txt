XVIII INTRODUCTION.

this power is unsound. Constantine, not Christ, is its origin,
as the Saints —— Augustine, for instance, and Bernard — bear
witness,

Others declare that Rome must be the seat of the Papacy,
because no other place has so many martyrs. But the place
does not sanctify the man. No other city was the theatre of so
many crimes; and many Popes fied from it on that account. If
the blood of martyrs sanctifies a place, then Jerusalem is the
holiest of all. But the Bishop of Rome is not necessarily the
Pope. Many Bishops of Rome have been wicked Antichrists.
Let us also not overlook ihe fact that an Apostle, who has to
preach to all nations, must not be bound to one, whilst he
may preach to another with greater success. That is one reason
why the Apostles would not accept a fixed endowment3 just
as Christ preferred to preach in the open air rather than in
the Temple. If we infer a constant relation between Rome and
the Papacy, because Peter constituted Clement there, we may
just as well say the same for Antioch, where he instituted Mark.
Here as well as there, Peter was Pope3 and moreover he was
respected by the people in Antioch, not in Rome.

He that confers power upon any one gives him only vi-
carious power, and not the same. If therefore Peter set up
Clement in Rome, it does not follow that the latter was, like
Peter, the Highest Bish0p3 when he died, there was no need
that his successor should be Pope. Christ died in Jerusalem,
where James became a Eishop, but not Pope. Should not James
therefore be Pope rather than Peter? Peter, unless he had a
Divine revelation, would give his succession to no one; and
that succession should have taken place as at the election of
Matthias. Had Peter any reason to give his succession to Clement
rather than to John who outlived him many a year? Was it not
rather Christ's desire that the Apostles should act in fellow-
ship, and obey each other, and serve each other, under His
own leadership?

It is a mere fiction to say that any one can become Pope
by a mere election under human prescriptions: there are no
grounds for this assertion. Any one might be [ι Bishop of Rome,
