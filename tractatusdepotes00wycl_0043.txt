INTRODUCTloN. XXXVII

what right can anyone excommunicate those faithful who are
opposed to such proceedings? It is indeed amazing how in our
days the Pope installs idiots who have no idea of spiritual
teaching, whilst there are numbers of men quite able to take
their place. If faith and religion are thus harmed‚ temporal
possession is to blame for it.1 This too is a sign of Anti-
christ, whom it is the first duty of the faithful to withstand.
Such leaders of the Church ought to be deprived of their bene-
fices. Should laws be promulgated to uphold them, obedience
should be denied to such laws. Excommunications therefore
are not to be dreaded. At present the Robertians excommuni-
cate the party of Urban VI and himself; and the latter does
likewise. Both seize upon the property of the Church, wher-
ever either is the stronger. O happy schism! cries Wyclif,
that teaches so many Catholic truths!2 How we should laugh
Robert of Geneva to scorn, if he launched an interdict against
us because we give no aid to his party! Just so we ought to
reject Urban VI with contempt, if, contrary to Christ's law, he
should grant property of the Church to unworthy men.3 Anti-
christ has by means of snares, i. e.‚ of Church laws, set him-
self above all secular persons; if these attempted* to depose
unworthy prelates‚ the clergy would oppose them.4 Their
chief pretends that laymen have no right to judge the
prelates' doings; he alone, he says, in virtue of his position,
has that right.5 The laity stands up for the laws and for peace,
for freedom and Royal authority3 the clergy makes laws for
the confusion of the country. One ought indeed to bestow
livings on worthy and distinguished men3 but this duty is
