a Pope may only be deposed for heresy? Wyclif answers that
all depends on what we understand by ‘Pope'3 and he once

more states his opinions on the matter, in a short summary.
What is a Pope? He is called Pope who excels all others in
marvellous sanctity, and who is to all men what Christ was to
the Apostles. And people call Pope the Bishop of Rome, con-
sidering his fortune alone, notv his sanctity.1 Others give the
title to any Bishop that, with Ambrose and Augustine, excels
the others in holiness.2 Nowadays‚ since the clergy interferes in
temporal affairs, those who settle temporal differences are called
Popes.3 Only the most saintly man on earth can be Pope.
No one is allowed to claim for himself pre-eminence in sanctity.
The insignia of the Papa] functions, too, are unnecessary3 so
also are his riches and external dignities. Temporalities ought
rightly to be taken from the clergy‚ because it is on account
of them that the Church has fallen from its once prosperous
state. Princes have the duty to protect the Church, but not to
enrich it; they should watch over the clergy, in order that
they live according to Christ's law; if the Pope hinders them
in this duty, he is a heretiC.4

How powerfully Wyclif’s arguments tend as a consequence
towards the complete separation and secularization of the whole
Church of England, may be seen by this powerful exhortation
of his: The King's power should be increased; be should not
allow a madman, in virtue of his privileges, to squander his
own property and that of the poor in the land; and he should

restore the Church to its condition in the days of the Apostles,
Such is the King's duty.5

1 Aliqui intelligunt papam, ut dicit super quoscunque alios mirabilem sancti-
tatem, sicut Christus se habuit ad suos apostolos. Et sic intelligunt homines de
Romano pontifice in hiis que lucrum et honorem mundanum sapiunt p. 367. 2 Ibid.

hoc sacrum regis officium⁷ habet racionem heretici et pessimi Antichristi p. 378.
⁵ Expergiscat igitur rex prudencia et non permittat maniacos per privilegia consumere

bona sua et bona pauperum regni sui, nam reducere ad statum primevum ecclesiam
regi principaliter spectat ad sui officium p. 379.
