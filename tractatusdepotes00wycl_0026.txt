XX INTRODUCTION.

It is an abuse of language to call every pseudo-pope a
Pope. When the Church became secularized‚ the Papacy and
the Roman See were separated. Radulphus de Diceto⁷ dean of
St. Paul’s‚ tells us how the Emperor Honorius put things to
rights when Eulalius set himself up against Pope Bonifaoe. At
that time, Papacy was less spoken against, and this power
that had been usurped was not respected so much that a
secular ruler who confiscated the tempora] possessions and
dignities of a Chu1·ch that went astray should be considered as
a schismatiC.1 From the same author Wyolif quotes a list of
depositions and of dissensions in the elections of the Popes,
which rendered it necessary for the secular judges to interfere.
“Then (says he) that law was still valid which empowered the
king, as Solomon of old (ΙΙΙ. Reg. II, 35), to depose the High
Priest.

The Pope was generally elected by the people of Rome,
before the secularisation of the Church, and the formation of
a sect unknown to Scripture -— the Cardinals, Since the En-
dowment, every century has witnessed some great quarrel
amongst the Popes, the cause of which was greed of tempora]
dignities and possessions. Then‚ too, it might be said, as Christ
said: “Many will come in my name, and say that they are
Christ.’‘ That can only be said of the Bishops of Rome who
blasphemously assert themselves to be the Vicars of Our Lord.
But here again we should say, both of those of Avignon and
of the others, “Believe them not3 their works show them all to
be Antichrists‚ whom we should fiee.”2 This passage shows
clearly that Wyclif’s attitude, even in respect to the obedience
due to Rome, is no longer what it was in 1378. And I believe
(he says) neither obedience has the conviction that their Pope

autum invaluit usurpacio Romani pontificis, quod suit reputatum hereticum, quod
domini temporales possent auferre temporalia, ymo dignitates atque officia ab ecclesia

nostris quibusdam dicentibus: Ecce hic Avenione est Christus et aliis dicentibus: Nolite
credere, quia indubie opera fidelia oportet ostendere vicarium Christi . . . Opera autem
ostendunt quod uterque eorurn sit Antichristus et per consequens fugiendus p. 185s6.
