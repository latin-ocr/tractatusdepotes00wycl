XXXVIII INTRODUCTION.

tyrannically‚ nay even blasphemously exaggerated by the
phantoms they evoke3 and it is just this that has rendered the
Church worldly and completely changed its constitution.1 But
ought we then to refuse paying tribute to a temporal lord, if
he be a tyrant or a sinner? Not so, Scripture commands us
to obey even a wicked master; and besides, the rights and
duties of a secular governor rest upon a quite different foun-
dation. Alms are a free gift to the clergy3 but the duties ot
subjects are based on compacts and rights that have no sort
of relation with the ruler⁷s worthiness or unworthiness.2

This passage is of great importance, because it proves
how little Wyclif's doctrine and attitude contributed towards
the Peasants' Rebellion in 1381; it is therefore worth while to
quote from it at greater length. Subjects ought, not by com—
pulsion but freely, to obey a master, though he be an utter
unbeliever3 and only in the case when he can be converted
by refusing to serve him and to pay taxes is this refusal
justifiable.

Many secular laws had their origin before the Christian
era3 they are often a mixture of good and evil. But they
are just for the most part, since they forbid robbery and other
unjust acts. Those decrees of Anfichrist, promulgated under
pretence of holiness and God's laws, are heretical, and it is the
duty of the faithful to resist thern.

The clergy should be properly recompensed, so as to be
in no want as regards food and clothing33 but they must have
no superfluous possessions3 especially such as may have come
to them by excommunication.4 Then would cardinals and un-
worthy foreigners no longer get tithes and revenues out of
England; these would go to worthy priests who faithfully
fulfil their duty. The holiness of their life and the edification
