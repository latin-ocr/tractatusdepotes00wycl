7. The primacy of Peter was not in worldly dignity, might,
and renown, but in humility and meekneSS, whereby he was
Christ's follower3 such is the opinion of St. Bernard, who, both
orally and in his wriffings, has declared that the Pope should
have no temporal power, because the Papacy and temporal
power, such as the laity are allowed to possess, are contrary
one to the other. The monks, the friam, the Apostles, lived
without possessions and power. Peter received the Power of
the Keys, not for himself, not for any Pope in particular, but
in general for every priest who, by imitating, shall resemble
him more closely. No special place, no election by men is ne-
cessary thereto, because the Gift of the Keys is aDivine mystery.
Those Keys are the power and the knowledge how to edify
the Church3 they should be apparent in the behaviour of every
priest, and they were certainly greater in Paul than in Peter.1
And this knowledge is the knowledge of Holy Scripture, with-
out which the power of the Keys cannot exist. John XXII and
others have abused it, hoarding up money, and making simple
people submit to their tyranny. If these abuses exist to—day‚
under the forms of Excommunications and Absolutions‚ it is
the work of the God of this World, who dazzles all Christians
with his avidity and pride.

The argument in favour of the primacy of the Roman See
are worthless. If, for instance, Peter walked upon the waves of
the sea, thus showing his ardent love of Christ, this proves
nothing in favour of Primacy. Only the humble and poor can
find room on board Christ's ship; such as despise the world,
and walk in the ways of Our Lord. If the Pope does so, then
indeed is he Christ's Ἥρω-,2 Peter’s Vicar has for his duty to
