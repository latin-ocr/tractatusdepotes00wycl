keep Christ’s flock; but if a so-called Pope sleeps in spiritual
slumbers, he stands sels-condemned and unfit for his office.1
When Popes wrangle about plenitude of power, whilst their
life and deeds are barren, and forgiveness of sins and penalties
is sold for money, and those who live according to Christ’s
example are persecuted by them‚ they are truly Antichrists.
To them do these words apply. “Many will come in my name,
saying, Ι am Christ, and will seduce many.‘’ Such is literally
the case to-day, whilst two claimants are· wrangliug for the Vicar
of Clzrist's posz‘tz'om.2 But Christ says: “Believe them not;'' that

ought to be satisfied with poverty; that would reconcile them. Since

deeds, which of them is the true Pope, let them hold their
peace in the faith of Christ7 until the Church shall decide be-
tween them3 and supposing that they are both good Catholic
priests, we are ready to submit to either as the Apostles sub-
mitted to Peter. But whosoever forces us to obey by deeds of
violence, is suspect by the very fact. Peter exacted no other
obedience save saith in Christ and the imitation of this example.
He craved no tempora] dominion, nor money‚ nor honours. Thus
neither the one (Urban VI) nor the other (Clement VII) has
any right to extort money from kingdoms and nations or from
private persons, unless he can find authority for his act in
Holy Writ. But should one of them preach the doctrine of
Christ with signs and miracles, as Peter spread the saith, then
would the people follow him joyfully: and only in this case
would it be lawful to follow such a leader. But whoso usurps
these functions to get money or to satisfy ‘his pride, commits
grievous sin. But now simony has taken such deep root, that
both the flock and the shepherd are rushing to destruction,
unless God brings back the clergy to evangelica] poverty. Who,
therefore, is Christ's true Vicar? He that lives like Christ and
