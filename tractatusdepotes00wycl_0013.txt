points to St. Peter's prerogatives; and because his virtue was
greater than that of the other Apostles, he was acknowledged
as the Head of the Church. His soul is adorned with three
virtues especially: Faith, Humility, and Leve.

4. Since Christ cannot abandon His Church, the successore
of Peter must still possess this Priniacy. But must his successors
necessarily be the Bishops of Rome? What qualities should
Peter's successor have? And how does a man become his
successor? As Peter became Christ’s Vicar, through his resem—
blance to his Master in life and doctrine, even so must it be
with his successors. That is a grace which Grod alone can grant;
and, therefore, the choice of the Head of the Church is not
valid, unless it agrees with God’s will. ‘Be ye my imitatorS, as
I am the imitator of Christ'‚¹ is the formula which St. Paul gives
us. For such an election‚ therefore, no law is necessary; and
the best form of electiori is that which best corresponds to
Christ's will. There are four ways of electing a Bishop. 1. Choice
by drawing lots. 2. Institution by another Bishop. 3. Hereditary
succession. 4. The present form of electiori. Of all the four,
that of drawing lots is the best; it was thus that Matthias was
elected. There is then no fear of 0110051ηὲΓ an unfit person.
Having nominated a certain number of the best, i. e., of the
most humble, let them draw lots. The objections to this mode
of electiori are worthless. The second mode would not be im-
pmper, it was thus that Peter instituted Mark in Alexandria,
and Clement in Rome, but this mode is now corrupted by
manifold heathen traditions. Institution by right of birth prevailed
under the Old Covenant, but there are now most valid reasons
against it: the Head of the Church ought to lead a life of
chastity, poverty and renunciation. But the present mode of
institution is the most undesirable of all; it is artificial and
dangerous. At any rate, electiori by drawing lots is more certain
and more authorized.2 The greed and ambition of those who
make the electiori is the cause of its not being adopted now.
