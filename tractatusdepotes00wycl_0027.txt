is the true one.1 Ours — that of Rome — is in the same case
as the other, for We have no proof, either by the deeds of
Urban VI or by special revelation, sufficient to convince us
that our Bishop of Rome is the Pope.2 lt would be better if
there were no Pope, and if we reverted to the practice anterior
to the secularization of the Church, when it was governed by
a council. Let us not preach blasphemous lies on behalf of
either side, for certainly neither of these is the true Pope,
and it therefore follows that he is Antichrist. We Englishmen
might remain in peace, as formerly, in the old religion of Christ.
If they both are Antichrists, the Church should be governed
without any such authority. But who can know this? Augustine
gives us three marks by which Antichrist is to be recognized.
They all of them apply to the present Popes.

9. If the militant Church must needs have a Pope, and no
one can be such who has not kept within St. Peter's limits, it
seems necessary that we should discuss these limits. Christ is
the Head of the whole Church. There must besides be one
who, predestined by God to edify the Church, is the Pope by
God’s election. It is thus that we should understand the passage
in the Decretal which relates to this matter.3 But, as has been
shown already, the Pope need not be the Bishop of Rome;
for if he is made a Pope, he must be the rightful Pope, and
therefore God alone can make him, since he must be the most
righteous and holy of men. Cardinals are unable to make such
a choice. Their Pope brings no advantage, but only harm to
the Church, the present form of Papal election is a scandal.4
What the Apostles durst not attempt has been introduced by
the Cardinals without authorization. Their Chief is superior in
power to all the Apostles save Peter. The Cardinals themselves

1 Wyclif does not use those very words here, but the sense is much the
same: ano credo indubie utroque clero, qui istis ambobus consensis, neuter clerus
habebit contra reliquam evidenciam, quod suus episcopus sit papa. 2 Nec nos
possumus contra illos ex operibus vel revelacione convincere, quod noster Romanus

pontifex sit papa p. 186. 3 Vll. qu. 1, cap. 41. 4 Ritus hodiernus est ecclesie
