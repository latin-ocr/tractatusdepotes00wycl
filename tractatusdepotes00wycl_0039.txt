glory in it, as though this took place by Divine ordinance.1
There are those who believe that the Church cannot exist, were
this hierarchy to fail, and their dispensation of the Sacraments
to cease. And therefore they punish those who disregard such
ceremonias more than they would a man who deserts the True
Faith. We may accept the threefold division of Bishop‚ Priest‚
and Servant, given by Dionysius; but the reception of a higher
Order is not a new sacrament. Thus we can scarcely assert
that no one will be saved who does not receive the Sacraments
in the manner accepted nowadayS. Sacerdotal and Episcopal
garments may be piously worn, though their primitive signifi-
cation has been changed, because the outward garb should
testify to our internal dispositions.

After a somewhat lengthy digression on sacerdotal vest-
ments in the Old Covenant‚ of which he speaks only to point
out their mystic signification, Wyclif proceeds to deal with the
objection that the Orders of the Church would be destroyed,
unless the Pope and a sufficient number of the upper clergy
possessed the full powers of Holy Orders. He answers: That
would be right for a Pope, but not for one such as are the
Popes in our days. Formerly every Apostle had, and now every
representative of the Apostles has, this plenitude of power. If
the Decretals teach that every Pope has much fuller power
than any Bishop not Bishop of Rome, it is a lie and a heresy.
Peter had no more power than the other Apostles. Why there-
fore set up such a monstrous idol as the Head of the whole
Body of Christ? Truly the Church can exist now as well
without such a Head as it did in the Apostles' time without
such a hierarchy3 and it may remain, now as then, satisfied
with the priesthood alone.2

As to vestments, even those that have no Scripture war-
rant may be retained, if they are suitable. Scripture would have
