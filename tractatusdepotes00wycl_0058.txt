LII INTRODUCTION.

at which the present work was written. Buddensieg assigns
the autumn of 1378 as the date of De Veritate S. Scripture.¹
Shirley gives the date as 1378 or 1379.2 De Ecclesia, as I have
stated,3 was written in the autumn and winter of 1378. Α5 De
Ecclesia and De Veritate were written at the same period, it
follows that Buddensieg's opinion is the right one. The tractate
De Potestate Papa could therefore not have been written either
before or during the year 1378. That De Veritate S. Scriptura
was anterior to De Poteslale is also proved by the fact that the
former tractate is quoted in the latter3 and indeed we find it
quoted with unmistakable distinctness4 We shall thus obtain
as the earliest possible date of this work, the year 1379. Let
us try whether we cannot also obtain a latest possible date,
by finding a reference to De Potestate Pape in one of Wyclif’s
later tractates. Such a reference we find twice in De simonia.
Once7 when he says that each Apostle in particular, unaware
of any supremacy attaching to St. Peter, ordained Bishops and
priests indifferently.5 Another time he tells us that the Popes
formerly begged alms in England, whereas they now claim the
first year's revenue, after each new installation of a Bishop.‘⁵
And De Simonia was written either at the end of 1379 or at
the beginning of 1380. We have therefore the year 1379 as the
date at which De Potestate was written.

In another tractate — De Eucharistia — there is also a
reference to De Potestate. “There are'’, says Wyclif‚ “many of
the faithfuP' who do not acknowledge the Bishops of Rome
either as their shepherd or even as members of the Church3
and on the other hand there are other Bishops who bring
more credit to the Church militant than they d0.⁷ Though the
date of De Eucharistia is not easy to fix, still a close investi-
gation shows us that it appeared before 1382. These tractates —-
