1NTRODUCT10N. XLIX

of which MS. C. 73 of Prague Domkapitel and MS. 3 F 11 of
the University Library contain the whole tractate; While the
MSS. 3 G16 and 2 E 3 possess extracts therefrom. When I
applied to the University Library in Prague concerning these
two last, I was informed on Feb. 13, 1905, that Shirley⁷s notice
was not accurate, and that no such extracts were to be found
in those two MSS. The letterings may possibly refer to other
libraries. But in the first volume of the catalogue of MSS. of
the Prague University Lim-ary, which was published later, it
is noted that in MS. III G. 16 (fol. 15b) there exists an extract
from De Potestaz‘e Pape1 As to 2 E 3, I can give no informa-
tion; but it matters very little⁷ since we possess the whole
tractate in two well—preserved MSS. The copy, which has been
made in Prague by a man of learning and ability, forms the
basis of the present edition.

The Codex C 73 (A) has already been employed, though
not described, in the editions of Wyelif’s De Apostasia and De
Blasphemia. Ι must thank Dr. Kamill Krosta, the able editor of
Acta Urbani et Bom‘facii IX (Monumenta Vaticana res themicas
illustrantia, torn. V) for the copy3 and also for the descriptions of
the MSS. The MS. contains De Blasphemia‚ from f. 11 to f. 86;
De Apostasia, from f. 86 to f. 161, and lastly De Potestate Pape
from f. 161b to f. 259³. The first ten and the eight last leaves
are blank. The treatise ends with the words: Explicit tractatus de
potestate pape Johaun'is W after which follows on f, 259: Cum
secundum sanctos spectat ad officium doctoris evangelici. This is
the T ractatus De Proplzetz'a, which is to be found in MS. III G. 11
of Prague University Library.2

In this MS. C. 73, after f. 262a come the words: Scm'ptoris
cuncti memores sint ista legentes, atque precentur ei requiem iu-
bilei. Neb gest toho dobree hoden (= Isto namque dignissimus est).
Finally the MS. contains a great part of the index, which con-
cludes with the words: Secundo principaliter arguit per hoc
quod ex officio et ornamentis sacerdotum. . . .
