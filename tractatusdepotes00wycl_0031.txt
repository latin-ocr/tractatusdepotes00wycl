INTRonuc‘riON. XXV

faithful, it can now continue to exist in the same way. st. Paul
gave us an example of such a system, when he made a col-
lection in Corinth for the Saints in Jerusalem. Now the Pope
decides how great a revenue he must get from England an-
nually.¹ Experience teaches us how greedy ofpossessions priests
are, the Bishops of every country are most greedy during their
pastoral visits; they care less for the souls of their diocesans
than for the profit they can get out of poor people; and for
this purpose superfluous rites and offices have been introduced.2
The Pope has no right to demand such sums of the English
nation. It is indeed just that every preacher should have where-
with to live. But the Pope does not preach the Gospel in Eng-
land; his demand is therefore made on secular, or rather, on
Imperial grounds. England is no part of the Roman Empire.
Constantine's donation gave the Pope no right over England;
and that is fortunate for us. We see how the institution of the
Empire has abased Germany3 ever since the time of its intro-
duction Germany has declined, and is now in such a state that
scarcely any Prince or Count will obey. Thus must fall every
State that being subject to this form of spiritual government‚
is forsaken by God.3 It suffices that England should be subject
to the Pope in so far as Scripture authorizes submission.
Secondly, it is averred that the Pope's authority comes
from Orod, not from the Emperor; and that this is demonstated
by the fact of the submission of all countries‚ and by the testi-
mony of the Doctors of the Church. This is true of the Roman
Church‚ if we mean thereby, not a basilica or a throng of people⁷
but Saints Peter and Paul and those who follow them. The
Decretal Sacroscmcta, on which they rely, deals with spiritual
primaey, not riches or worldly renown.4 But the fact of coun-
