Peter; for no one becomes a Pope by taking that title, nor by
election; but only he that preaches the Gospel where Christ’s
Narne is unknown, until, Christ being received into apt vessels,
lte monlds the Chmfclz according to tlte four Gospels; who gives his
life for the fallen ones, lays his helping hands upon them, and
leads his flock into a fold built up with strong stones. To such
a shepherd, who could refuse St. Peter's place? Such was
St. Peter's behaviour. There was no quarrel about supremacy
then: if Peter spoke first amongst his brethren‚ he did so with
humility. Consider how St. James spoke after St. Peter. He
says: “1 judge;'' an expression that would in our days be most
severely condemned.l Yet Peter did not call James to account
for those words, nor did he desire supremacy over his brethren;
may, he submitted to the Apostle who rebuked him. Let the
Pope rest convinced that no one owes him obedience‚ save
when he preaches (irod's law and Holy Scripture; that con-
sideration will urge him to preach the law of God. How can
he make others better? Let him begin by amending himself,
by patient behaviour and suffering of hardships, by remem-
bering that he is only a servant of the Church, which is greater
than he. If Peter received the office of Pastor, that was because
of his love for Christ and his people. What if a Pope has no
such love? Can it be believed that Christ accepts the person
of the Bishop of Rome, on account of an election made according
to human laws, whilst the man is Christ's adversary in life and
doctrine? What folly! 'l‘herefore let the Pope remam within
the bounds os poverty and self-denial, as set down in Christ's
words to Peter.

8. What is meant by the word, Popessff It is nowhere to
be found in Scripture. Bishops formerly received this title3 the
Greeks call their priests by this name even noyv. It is only
since the Endowment‚ the beginning of the Tempora] Power,
that the Bis-hep of Rome has been given this title. Let us
suppose, says Wycliff that a Bishop who like Peter represents
