the Bible‚ since Papal decisions are often perplexing3 they set
forth as a Divine ordinance what is not so. It is said that as
there are nine orders of Angels, so there are nine degrees of
power. The first (after Christ) is that of the Apostles, who
fulfilled their function according to His command. When Christ
ceased to live on earth, there were other Apostles (as Paul
and Barnabas) whose functions were those of Bishops. In the
second place came prophetS‚ who preached to the people‚ and
were endowed with knowledge of the Gospel, of past testimonies
and of the future. The Apostles prophesied with greater depth
and vital strength ancl fruit than the prophets of the Old
Covenant. In the third place come the Doctors, who teach the
Gospel and the Prophets in public. Then comes the second
hierarchy of power:1 some have the gift of working miracles,
others of healing the sick, others give help to the poor. The
third hierarchy is that of the leaders of the people. They should
have the discernment of spiritual gifts‚ in order to lead every
one in the way in which he should go; they must understand
the language of those subject to them, and be able to explain
God's Word. Such are the powers by which the Church is
governed‚ and which endure until mortal sin is committed. The
highest gift bestowed on man is the grace of predestination.

3. These ecclesiastica] powers being therefore known, it
still remains to consider the power of that first of all priests,
whom some call the Pope‚ and others the Roman High Priest.
Which of the Apostles possessed the Primacy after Christ?
Peter, says Fitz-Ralph; and he gives the following reason.
Peter loved Christ most, even more than John did; for His
sake, he plunged headlong into the sea. He received the primacy
of rank, and is named first among the Apostle53 he alone received
the keys of Heaven; he was commanded to corne to the Master
on the waters. He alone was called to watch with our Lord3
he alone drew ashore the net containing 153 great fishes; he
alone was taught by Christ how to mete out punishment; he
alone was told to feed Christ’s sheep and His lambs. All this
