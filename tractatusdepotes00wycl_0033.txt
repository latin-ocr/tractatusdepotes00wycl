iNTRomicTioN. XXVII

Again‚ it is pointed out that certain Saints approved of
the endowment of the Church. Otherwise there would be no
decree, either of Pope or of Bish0p‚ to decide in spiritual
matters; the Church would have no Head. To this we reply
that those Saints who approved the endowment against God⁷s
will, committed a sin; for if much good have resulted there-
from‚ so has also evil, and still greater evil. It has been the
cause of many dissensious in the Church, and the primary origin
of corrupt elections. Let us but endeavour to take away all
Church property; we shall see then whether Church dignities
will be so much sought after.1 It is therefore a doctrine of
Antichrist to dazzle laymen‚ which says that the Church is
robbed when its property is confiscated.

Those Saints who approved the endowment of the Church,
must certainly have repented. Why do we pray that God may
give us our daily bread?

Returning to the question of spiritual power, we must
divide it into two kinds3 one granted by God, the other by
the Emperor. The first alone is necessary to the good of the
soul. To say that the other is also needful, and that without a
Pope having this kind of power, we cannot be saved, is a
most wicked heresy. If this diabolical hierarchy did not exist,
it were much better for the Church3 and no arguments put
forth in its behalf have the least value.

What therefore should we think of this hierarchy? We
should only believe in it when it preaches the Word of God;
and so⁷ too, as to obedience either to Urban VI or to Robert
of Geneva.2 It is no dogma of faith that one of these two is
the Pope.3 Blessed be God, the God of nuth, who made this
schism to be, because only now can this true doctrine be put
in practice! Here Wyclif's language is highly interesting, since,
in spite of the praise he bestows on Urban VI, he still says

1 Cuius causa experiencia doceri poterit, si subtracta dotat-ione cessaret aspi-
racio ad huiusmodi dignitates p. 238. 2 Nec Urbano nec Roberto tenetur fidelis
credere, nisi de quanto fidem scripture dixerit p. 248. 3 Nec est de substancia
fidei explicite credere alterurn eorum esse papam, ib.
