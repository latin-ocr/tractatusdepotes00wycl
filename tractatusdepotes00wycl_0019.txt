the Antichrist, who, as is well known, will come out of the
clergy. A man may nominally be a Pope, and yet possess the
attributes of Antichrist. This was Wyclif’s favourite theme in
his last years, Antichrist has eleven characteristics. Whereas
Christ is truth, he is a consummate liar, who instead of following
Christ in his words and writings, his life and morals, does ex-
actly the contrary, and instead of being Christ⁷s faithful Vicar,
leads the people into temptation. Christ loves poverty3 Anti-
christ, treasures and worldly power. Christ left us the Bible as
the sole source of all wisdom: Antichrist invents1 new laws,
which have no foundation in Scripture. Christ chose poor men
despised by the world for His Apostles; the Pope chooses men
of the greatest renown (though they are deceitful wretches) to
be, as he supposes, the masters of the world. Christ commands
His disciples to preach the Gospel to the whole world3 the
Pope, sitting on his. throne in his palace, like another Chosroes,
despises this duty, and sends forth his menials to grow fat in
stolen castles. Christ taught His Apostles to sustain persecu-
tions and sufferings3 the Pope's hirelings struggle and fight for
temporal dominion. Christ forbade His followers to wield the
sword: the Pope pays his mercenary troops with the money
of the poor. Christ refused to rev-enge Himsel'f upon the Sama-
ritans, who denied Him the necessaries of life; the Pope lays
an interdict on those who resist his tyranny. Christ submitted
to His judges3 the Pope thrusts himself forward as the uni-
versal judge. Christ concealed His Deity under a human form;
the Pope foists himself on the people as a demi-god, nay, as
God, and no one is permitted to judge him. The Apostles, by
Christ²s own command, foi-bade any one to confer power for
money: the Pope seizes upon all the fattest livings and gives
them to his own people. All these are the deeds of Antichrist,
deceiving Christendom. There are also many sophistical argu-
ments, which tend towards the same object. For instance, that
the condition of the clergy is infinitely superior to that of the
laity; that therefore it is not seemly that the latter should judge
