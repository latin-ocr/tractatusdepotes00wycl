Such privileges as the Pope grants to laymen and to the
clergy are either of slight importance - as, for instance, the
use of domestic altars — or dispensations which are of no
avail, unless they have already been granted by God. When
Wyclif in the sequel comes to the question of obedience‚ he
does not, as might have been expected in the times of the
Great schism, take one side or the other, but be affirms (as
he does all through this tractate) that whenever a Pope takes
any measures contrary to God's laW, he is not to be obeyed.¹
There were of old persons abler than he to settle differences
within the Churchss When we are told that in virtue of his
supreme authority, his officials have power to decide, since he
alone has the right to convoke a Council, this is an empty and
imaginary tradition-⁹> It is by an illumination from God and
with complete unanimity that a Council should assemble.4 Here
the Pope may act together with them, and in case he should
fail, another — the Emperor, for instance, —— or any of the
faithful, might take his place.

Finally, Wyclif draws up a synopsis of Papal abuses.
There are twelve of them. 1. The form of Papal elections, un-
warranted by Scripture. 2. The greed of temporal honours;
whereas Popes should be the servants of their brethren.
3. Temporal power which, as St. Bernard says, is a prison to
the Pope's spiritual life. 4. Boasts as to Papal omnipotence,
which do not amount to much. 5. Excitations to wars and
fighting, that the Popes' power may thereby be increased.
o. Greed not only of possessions and of money, but also of
predominance over the brethren. 7. A lack of the requisite
purity of heart. 8. Burdens which are laid upon them, and
which on account of their honours and possessions, they are
not able to bear. 9. Their claim to give leaders to Christen-
dom, and the provisions, reservations and privileges which they
