5. The Edition.

The Editor has in the present volume followed the same
principles as in his former editions of the Wyclif texts. It only
remains for him to thank all those persons and associations
that have aided him in his work. Thanks are due in the first
place to the indefatigable Mr. F. D. Matthew‚ who came to
my aid with numerous hints which his abundant treasure of
knowledge of Wycliffian literature supplied, and who has pro-
vided the text with such excellent side-notes, that even a
reader who knows nothing of Scholastic terminology will be
able to follow the arguments. The editor owes a debt of gra-
titude equally great to Dr. F. J. Furnivall, who provided him
with an excellent copy of the MS. (made by Patera) perfect in
every respect, save that the side-notes to the Metropolitan MS.
were wanting. I was supplied with them by the assistance of
Kamill Krofta, for which I am indebted to the kindness of
Mr. Novacek, Director of the Landesarchiv. I take this opport-
unity to thank them both, and also the Director of the Prague
University Library, and Dr. Eichler‚ of the Graz University
Library‚ who spared no trouble to procure the MSS.
