bestowed on them may, therefore, be disregarded3 and though
they have taken temporalities, that is no reason why these
should not be taken back again. Temporalities in themselves
are not hurtful, but the abuse thereos is. Church property is
the patrimony of the poor3 the clergy should take thence what
is necessary towards the fulfilment of their dutieS. Such was
the practice of those Saints who should be praised by all.

past, said to Pope Eugenius: “In this you have obeyed, not
St. Peter, but the Emperor Constantine'’. If the Pope would
renounce temporal possessions, God would bestow upon him
more perfect gifts. and the power of working miracles.

What of the Pope's jurisdiction over all the Church? We
must distinguish between the power of the clergy and that of
ecclesiastical government. According to Fitz-Ralph‚ all priests
have the same spiritual power; but in his opinion there is a
difference as to jurisdiction. This is given to Peter and to his
suecessors3 facts prove this, and the Church Canons as to
ecclesiastical jurisdiction agree on this point. As to this last,
he is right. But neither from God's law, nor the Bible. nor the
dogmas of the Church, can we infer such a groundless extension
of Papal jurisdiction over all Christendom3 its origin is more
truly Pagan. Ecclesiastical government is in reality a power
which is not founded upon human institutions‚ but on the fact
that God has entrusted to a Bishop a larger or a smaller part
of the Church. This is irrelevant to the human institution of
primacy; it only bears on the greater power which God bestows
